Car's Controling codes
====

This directory contains the codes that we used to control the car and the steering wheel by detecting the red and green colors through the camera connected to the Raspberry Pi. When the car approaches this color, the Raspberry Pi sends a message to the Arduino and the Arduino takes the appropriate action.
